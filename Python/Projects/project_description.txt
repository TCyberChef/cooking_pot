Functions:

This project will be 2 parts, server and client.

Server:

1. The server is installed on a Linux server.
2. The server should alert when a client is visiting a blacklisted website.
3. The server should display an alert when the communication is blocked between the client and server is lost.

Client:

1. the client code should support Linux and Windows operating systems.
2. The client should send a "heartbeat" to the server every few seconds, so the server knows the client is still connected.
3. the client alerts the server when a duplicate mac address is found in the ARP table.

Logs:

1. all alerts should be logged to a file and saved on the server.
2. Each event should display when, where, and what happened.
