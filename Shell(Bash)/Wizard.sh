# So basically, I wanted to make this game a long time ago.And I only got around to it just now.
# The game is about The Wizard who wonders around the wonderful land. he overcomes a lot of obstacles 
# You're going to take care of The Wizard and make his choices for him.
# Or you may choose to  mischief and play games with The Wizard and basically kill him

# The game is written in bash, so I had limited features. But I went all out, 
# and I always want to add features and renew the game.
